# On the benefit of context in the form of neighboring tissues on classification performance
The repository contains the source code for the results presented in the paper **On the benefit of context in the form of neighboring tissues on classification performance** (TBD). In the paper, we investigate the benefit from the access to contextual information when doing classification of histopathological tissues. We also evaluate whether images with different context sizes given to the model may result in different predictions. 


### Setup
We recommend creating a new conda virtual environment:
```
conda create -n PCam_context python=3.8 -y
conda activate PCam_context
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
.......................


Note that in bash scripts, it is necessary to specify a path to files with data and a path where the output is supposed to be saved.
